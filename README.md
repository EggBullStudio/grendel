Grendel
=======

What Grendel Is
---------------

Grendel is a RESTful web service which allows for the secure storage of users'
documents. When a Grendel user is created, an OpenPGP keyset (a master key for
signing/verifying and a sub key for encrypting/decrypting) is generated. When
the user stores a document, the document is signed with the user's master key
and encrypted with their sub key.


Requirements
------------

* Java 1.6.0 (ideally 1.6.0_17 or newer)
* Bouncy Castle JCE Provider (1.44 or newer)

To install Bouncy Castle, follow these steps:

1. Download the
   [latest release of the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider](http://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html)
   (1.44 or newer, no IDEA required â€” for instance, `bcprov-jdk16-144.jar`) and
   copy it to the `lib/ext` directory of your Java install. (On OS X this is
   `/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6.0/Home/lib/ext`.)
2. Add the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider to your list of allowed JCE providers by
   editing the `security/java.security` file in your Java install and adding
   the following line:
   
        security.provider.<n>=org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider
   
   Where <n> is the number greater than the last number in that section.
   
   For example:
   
        security.provider.1=sun.security.pkcs11.SunPKCS11 ${java.home}/lib/security/sunpkcs11-macosx.cfg
        security.provider.2=sun.security.provider.Sun
        ... etc ...
        security.provider.10=sun.security.smartcardio.SunPCSC
        security.provider.11=org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider
   
   For more information, please refer to the
   [Bouncy Castle documentation](http://www.bouncycastle.org/specifications.html#install).


How To Build It
---------------

Run `mvn clean package` and look for the JAR file in the `target` directory.


How To Set It Up
----------------

Grendel requires a single configuration file, usually named
`grendel.properties`. It should look something like this:

    hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5InnoDBDialect
    hibernate.connection.username=grendel
    hibernate.connection.password=magicsecretsauce
    hibernate.connection.url=jdbc:mysql://grendel.db:3306/grendel?zeroDateTimeBehavior=convertToNull
    hibernate.c3p0.min_size=10
    hibernate.c3p0.max_size=50
    hibernate.generate_statistics=true

The `zeroDateTimeBehavior=convertToNull` option may be required to compensate
for MySQL's storage of null `DATETIME` values as all-zero strings.

It's recommended that your properties file be stored so that only the system
user running the Grendel server can access it.

Once you have the properties file in place, create a database and a database
user for Grendel.  Create the tables Grendel needs by generating a full database
schema script (see _How To Run It_, below) and running it. For instance:

    java -jar target/grendel-${VERSION}.jar schema --migration -c grendel.properties > setup-grendel.sql
    mysql -u grendel -p grendel < setup-grendel.sql


How To Run It
-------------

For help, simply run:
    
    java -jar target/grendel-${VERSION}.jar

(Replace `${VERSION}` with whatever version you're running.)

To generate a full database schema script, run this:
    
    java -jar target/grendel-${VERSION}.jar schema -c grendel.properties

To generate a migration database schema script, run this:

    java -jar target/grendel-${VERSION}.jar schema --migration -c grendel.properties

To run Grendel as a web service, run this:
    
    java -jar target/grendel-${VERSION}.jar server -c grendel.properties -p 8080

This will run Grendel on port 8080.


How To Try It
-------------

All of the operations documented below are demonstrated with shell scripts that you
can find in the [examples directory](http://github.com/wesabe/grendel/tree/master/examples/).
These assume that Grendel is running on localhost, port 8080.  Run them with arguments as shown
in the source; for instance:

    ./create-user.sh coda seekritpass

The full request and response will be shown as output.


The Users Resource (`/users/`)
------------------------------

The **Users Resource** provides access to the collection of Grendel users.

No authentication is required for this resource.

`GET`
-----

Sending a `GET` request to `/users/` will return an `application/json` object
with a list of all users' ids and URIs:

    > GET /users/ HTTP/1.1
    > Accept: application/json
    >
    
    < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    < Content-Type: application/json
    <
    < {
    <   "users":[
    <       {
    <           "id":"user1",
    <           "uri":"http://example.com/users/codahale"
    <       }
    <   ]
    < }

The `uri` property is the absolute URI of the user's **User Resource**.


`POST`
------

Sending a `POST` request to `/users` with an `application/json` object will
create a new user and return the URI of the new user's **User Resource**.

    > POST /users/ HTTP/1.1
    > Content-Type: application/json
    >
    > {
    >   "id": "codahale",
    >   "password": "woowoo"
    > }
    
    < HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    < Location: http://example.com/users/codahale

Both the `id` and the `password` properties are **required**. This action may
take some time (~1s), as Grendel will generate an OpenPGP keyset for the user.

**N.B.:** The user's id is immutable; use an immutable piece of data (e.g., a
primary key) instead of a modifiable piece of data (e.g., a username or email
address).


The User Resource (`/users/{id}`)
---------------------------------

The **User Resource** provides access an individual user's metadata.

Basic authentication, using the user's id and password, is required for all
methods of this resource.

`GET`
-----

Sending a `GET` request to `/users/codahale` will return an `application/json`
object with information about the user `codahale`:

    > GET /users/codahale HTTP/1.1
    > Accept: application/json
    > Authorization: Basic Y29kYWhhbGU6d29vd29v
    >
    
    < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    < Content-Type: application/json
    < 
    < {
    <   "id":"codahale",
    <   "modified-at":"20091227T211120Z",
    <   "created-at":"20091227T211120Z",
    <   "documents":[
    <       {
    <           "uri":"http://example.com/users/codahale/document1.txt",
    <           "name":"document1.txt"
    <       }
    <   ],
    <   "keys":"[2048-RSA/0A895A19, 2048-RSA/39D1621B]"
    < }

The `documents` property is a list of all the user's documents, including
absolute URIs.


`PUT`
-----

Sending a `PUT` request to `/users/codahale` with an `application/json` object
will change the user `codahale`'s password:

    > PUT /users/codahale HTTP/1.1
    > Content-Type: application/json
    > Authorization: Basic Y29kYWhhbGU6d29vd29v
    >
    > {
    >   "password": "secretstuff"
    > }
    
    < HTTP/1.1 204 No Content

The `password` property is **required**. The Basic authentication should use the
old password; the next request will require Basic authentication credentials
with the new password.


`DELETE`
--------

Sending a `DELETE` request to `/users/codahale` will delete user `codahale`
**and** all their documents:

    > DELETE /users/codahale HTTP/1.1
    > Authorization: Basic Y29kYWhhbGU6d29vd29v
    >
    
    < HTTP/1.1 204 No Content


The Document Resource (`/users/{id}/{name}`)
--------------------------------------------

The **Document Resource** provides access a user's documents.

Basic authentication, using the user's id and password, is required for all
methods of this resource.


`GET`
-----

Sending a `GET` request to `/users/codahale/document1.txt` will return the
document named `document1.txt` belonging to user `codahale` in whatever content
type the document was stored with:

    > GET /users/codahale/document1.txt HTTP/1.1
    > Authorization: Basic Y29kYWhhbGU6d29vd29v
    >
    
    < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    < Content-Length: 10
    < Cache-Control: private, no-cache, no-store, no-transform
    < Content-Type: text/plain
    <
    < yay for me


`PUT`
-----

Sending a `PUT` request to `/users/codahale/document1.txt` will store the
request entity as `document1.txt` with the specified content type:

    > PUT /users/codahale/document1.txt HTTP/1.1
    > Content-Type: text/plain
    > Authorization: Basic Y29kYWhhbGU6d29vd29v
    >
    > i am super secret

    < HTTP/1.1 204 No Content

Sending `PUT` request to an existing document will overwrite its contents;
doing so to a non-existent document will create it.


`DELETE`
--------

Sending a `DELETE` request to `/users/codahale/document1.txt` will delete the
document named `document1.txt` belonging to user `codahale`:

    > DELETE /users/codahale/document1.txt HTTP/1.1
    > Authorization: Basic Y29kYWhhbGU6d29vd29v
    >

    < HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
